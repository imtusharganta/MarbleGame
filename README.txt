HELLO!!
I decided to make own game which has to do with Marbles 
where we go up against the computer in guessing marbles.
How this works is the game will ask us if we want to play.
If we dont, then it will quit. If yes, it is going to ask us 

"Odd or Even?"

we press 1 for Even and 2 for Odd.
We then roll a die which determines how many marbles we either win or lose.
If we guess the type of number correctly, we take that many marbles from 
the opponent. Both start with 10 Marbles. First one to 20 marbles wins.
